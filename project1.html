							<h1>Core Shot Productions</h1>
							<p>An independent freeride collective.</p>
							</header>
							<p>Core Shot was a passion project which started in early 2015. Its purpose was to
								connect a group of people who shared the same drive and wanted to create an independent freeride ski movie without major funding or professional equipment. <br>
								The humble goal to produce an online-release ski movie with a decent story developed throughout multiple trips and adventures into the creation of a "Sport & Lifestyle" <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coreshotproductions/">social-media brand</a> with a cinema release of the feature film <a href="https://youtu.be/X77flBgc5w0">"CHOICES"</a> in Karlsruhe in October 2016.</p>

										<h2>Project History<br>
										</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										
										<p>The main idea to create a feature-length ski movie came from Alexander Gauthier after attening the Red Bull Offlines Camp in Kl√∂ster am Arlberg in 2015. He got the chance to connect with multiple young and talented freeriders. Alex and I have been to school together and shared the adventure of a long ski trip to British Columbia. He contacted me, shared the idea and asked if I wanted to get on board of the project and help with design work and management of social media. Alex is a very passionate and nice person who is capable of chewing through intense workloads to achieve his goals, I did not hesitate to join him on this journey.</p>

										<blockquote>The name "Core Shot Productions" is based on the thing all winter sport fans hate: hitting rocks beneath the snow in back country terrain and tear through the base of the skis - resulting in a core shot. </blockquote>

										<h3>My role in this project</h3>
										<p><span class="image left lightbox"><img src="images/csp/logo.png" alt="" /></span>
											From the start on I was involved with the creative process regarding story-crafting, logo and graphic design as well as planning the general direction of the social media channels. <br>
											<p>One of my first tasks was the logo design to give the project a regognizable face. I enjoy sketching ideas, refining them and make them pixel perfect in Sketch oder Illustrator, therefore this process came quite naturally to me. At that time polygon graphics were on the rise and I took inspiration from them. My goal was to create a square format logo with high contrast and polygon shapes that fit into the freeskiing & wintersports theme.
											These characteristics came from aquite pragmatic standpoint: most social media profiles use a square format for profile pictures, they can get very small on mobile plattforms therefore need to be high in contrast to be visible. Last but not least it is cheaper to print a suqare format sticker than a custom format one.</p>
											The bright red logo version prevailed against all other logo prototypes and was met with positive feedback throughout the group. In the coming months this logo in combination with high quality skiing content helped us gain traction on social media plattforms, above all <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coreshotproductions/">Instagram</a>.
											Today, two years later the logo can be found on stickers across ski resorts around Germany, Austria and Switzlerand, on a limited run of sports apparel and throught the <a href="https://www.freeskiers.net/freeskiers-net-news/core-shot-productions-choices.html">internet</a>.

										<h2>Insights<br>
										</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>Throughout the project I was a full-time student at the University of Hamburg. Organisation & communication became a very important part of the work we put in. Since all of the Core Shot members were scattered all across Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it was necessary to plan trips well and far in advance as well as motivate less-experienced members to take on organising for on-location shooting due to their intense knowledge of the terrain in the mountains.<br>
										We had good times and we had bad times. Shooting videos in the mountains is very challenging and exhausting. The quality of the footage depends largely on the weather, teamwork and ability to go the extra mile (quite literally) to get the best perspective. Turning such a project into a success is a team effort and therefore the connections and goal orientation of all memebers needs to be cared for very carefully.
										Early on there were many people involved, not all of them stayed on board until the end of the project. To get everybody working together visualization of the common goal is very important. Not only to bring the endproduct to its maximum potential but keep to your team members motivated through difficult conditons like a bad winter, injuries or financial stress.
										</p>
										<p>
										Releasing the feature film online and seeing the viewers reations at the premiere in Karlsruhe was a very proud moment for all of us, especially Alexander. In the end we forged an intense friendship among all team members, made new experiences and memories on which we can feast for a long time.
